<h1>About Unicode Cleaner</h1>

<p>
Unicode Cleaner is a free online tool designed to detect and remove hidden Unicode characters 
such as zero-width spaces (U+200B), non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), byte order marks (U+FEFF), 
and other invisible formatting characters.
</p>

<p>
These hidden characters often appear when copying text from AI tools, PDFs, Microsoft Word, 
or websites. While invisible, they can break JSON files, cause syntax errors in code, 
disrupt database entries, and trigger unexpected validation failures.
</p>

<h2>Why This Tool Exists</h2>

<p>
Developers, students, and content creators frequently encounter frustrating copy-paste issues. 
Unicode Cleaner was created to provide a fast, private, and browser-based solution 
to instantly detect and remove problematic characters.
</p>

<h2>Privacy First</h2>

<p>
Unicode Cleaner runs entirely in your browser. No text is uploaded, stored, 
or transmitted to any server. Everything happens locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>Who Is It For?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developers debugging JSON or code errors</li>
<li>Students submitting assignments</li>
<li>Writers copying from AI tools</li>
<li>Anyone facing invisible character issues</li>
</ul>

<p>
